# Turbine
Turbine allows different processes to work with the same JSON database. It works as a service receiving requests and returning, storing or querying data as quick as possible.

### The problem
I have multiple clusters working with the same data. For them it isn't an effort to read from a JSON database and work with data. The problem appears when those clusters **try** to store data on database at the same time.

Multiple processes working with the same file can produce writing errors. Imagine the consequences.

### The solution
Turbine is a single process that manages a JSON database for you. It allows to work with the same data on different clusters or processes avoiding fatal errors writing on database. It has been designed for [Rotor server](https://github.com/rotorlab/server-node) but can be used as a query engine.

### Benchmark
For check how fast is Turbine, there is a performance comparision with [GraphQL engine](http://graphql.org). Both are used as servers that receive requests and do some process.
Additionally, both servers work with pre-loaded data.

|Action  |GraphQL  |Turbine| Times |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET  | 37.6 s. | 2.7 s. | x1000
| POST  | 2.5 s. | 2.1 s. | x1000
| QUERY  | 46.9 s. | 2.1 s. | x1000

For more details, check [Benchmark](https://github.com/rotorlab/server-node/tree/master/benchmark) section.

### Installation
```bash
npm install @rotor-server/turbine --save
```

### Usage
The idea is to start a server (in Process A) and all processes (Process A, Cluster A, Cluster B, Process B, Process C) are able to ask for data.

#### prepare Turbine
```javascript
const Turbine = require('@rotor-server/turbine');
let turbine = new Turbine({
    "turbine_port": 4004,
    "turbine_ip": "http://localhost",
    "db_name": "database",
    "debug": true
});
```
#### server
Starts Turbine server on a different process. This should be called first when your API is starting.
```javascript
turbine.server();
```
```bash
╭───────────────────╮
│                   │
│                   │
│      turbine      │
│                   │
│                   │
╰───────────────────╯

started on 4005 (15.749 secs)
0 op/sec
```
Once Turbine is started, you can use client methods.
#### get
Client method that looks for an object on the given path.
```javascript
turbine.get("/users/usersA").then(function(user) {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(user))
}
```
#### post
Client method that updates or removes an object on the given path passing another object or null.
```javascript
turbine.post("/users/usersB", newUser).then(function() {
    console.log("stored")
}
```
#### query
Client method that looks for an object on the given path for the conditions passed.
```javascript
turbine.query("/users/*", { name: "Matt" }).then(function(users) {
    for (let user in users) {
        console.log(JSON.stringify(users[user]))
    }
});
```

### Usage on clusters
```node
const cluster = require('cluster');
const numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length;
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const timeout = require('connect-timeout');
const Turbine = require('@rotor-server/turbine');

let turbine = new Turbine({
    "turbine_port": 4004,
    "turbine_ip": "http://localhost",
    "db_name": "database",
    "debug": true
});

let port = 3003;

if (cluster.isMaster) {
    turbine.server();

    let workers = [];
    let spawn = function (i) {
        workers[i] = cluster.fork();
        workers[i].on('exit', function (code, signal) {
            console.log('respawning worker ' + i);
            spawn(i);
        });
    };
    for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
        spawn(i);
    }
} else {
    var app = express();
    app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: true}));
    app.use(bodyParser.json({limit: '50mb'}));
    app.use(timeout('120s'));
    app.route('/')
        // turbine server has been started, start managing data
        .get(async function (req, res) {
            if (req.body.query !== undefined) {
                let object = await turbine.query(req.body.path, req.body.query);
                res.json(object);
            } else {
                let object = await turbine.get(req.body.path);
                res.json(object);
            }
        })
        .post(async function (req, res) {
            await turbine.post(req.body.path, req.body.content);
            res.json({});
        });
    app.listen(port, function () {
        console.log("cluster started on port " + port + " | worker => " + cluster.worker.id);
    });
}
